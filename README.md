Completed the PyCitySchools Assignment. Code is found in: PyCitySchools/PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb


A couple very clear trends - especially in the exercises which listed out the top 5 performing schools and the bottom 5 performing schools. It was demonstrated in the last exercise as exercise as well which separated out district from charter schools. District schools performed a real step lower than charter schools on average grades - but the striking difference is in the percentage of students passing from district and charter schools.

Another noteworthy data point is the percentage of students passing both math and reading when looking at school sizes. The students from schools with less than 2000 students passed classes at a much higher rate than the students from schools with greater than 2000 students. This might be due to the fact that this is nearly the same split as district/charter schools.

I found it interesting that none of the schools showed significant differences in math/reading scores regardless of charter/district from grade 9 through grade 12.

Also interesting that school budget per student was inversely correlated with passing rate - you'd expect schools with higher budgets per student to have higher passing rates but the opposite is true.
